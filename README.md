Save game data for the Kerbal Community Space Station

====

Recently I noticed that [Kerbal Space Program](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com)
saves game data in plain text files. So, I got thinking... why not put a saved
game in a github repository so that friends can help build something much larger
and more impressive than I could build myself.

So, here it is.


Description
===========

Current the Kerbal Community Space Station is a modular space station. The idea
is for various members of the community to build new modules, launch them, dock
and then commit the save game data.


How To Play
===========

Just put the "saves" directory from this repository in your KSP directory.


Rules
=====

*	Anyone is free to play this save game

*	Do not use any non-standard part, with the exception of mech-jeb. If you do
	then others will not be able to load the save game.

*	We will not be resolving conflicts. If someone else commits while you are
	playing then your session can not be merged back into the main branch.

	If you have any ideas for improving this please let me know.

*	If you are playing and would like others not to commit update this file to
	make it clear that you are in a mission.

*	If you would like to join the community start by sending me a craft file of
	a module you would like to add to the space station. After a quick once over
	I will give you commit rights.

*	Commit rights will be revoked if you don't follow these rules.
