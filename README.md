Save game data for the Kerbal Community Space Station

====

Recently I noticed that [Kerbal Space Program](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com)
saves game data in plain text files. So, I got thinking... why not put a saved
game in a github repository so that friends can help build something much larger
and more impressive than I could build myself.

So, here it is.


Description
===========

Current the Kerbal Community Space Station is a modular space station. The idea
is for various members of the community to build new modules, launch them, dock
and then commit the save game data.


How To Play
===========

Just put the "community" directory from this repository in your KSP "saves"
directory. This can be done with a symlink.

You will also need to install [mechjeb](http://kerbalspaceport.com/21mechjeb209/).



Rules
=====

*	Anyone is free to play this save game

*	Do not use any non-standard part, with the exception of
*	[mechjeb](http://kerbalspaceport.com/21mechjeb209/). If you do
	then others will not be able to load the save game.

*	We will not be resolving conflicts. If someone else commits while you are
	playing then your session can not be merged back into the main branch.

	If you have any ideas for improving this please let me know.

*	If you are playing and would like others not to commit update this file to
	make it clear that you are in a mission.

*	If you would like to join the community start by sending me a craft file of
	a module you would like to add to the space station. After a quick once over
	I will give you commit rights.

*	Commit rights will be revoked if you don't follow these rules.


History
=======
*	October 3, 2013: Launched initial core module into orbit around kerbin. This
	core module is very basic. It has a few solar panels, RCS, and 5 open docking
	ports.

	Each docking port has a removable adapter so that you can use either size
	docking port.

*	October 4, 2013: Started over. Destroyed original core, and launched an
	upgraded core module which can house 5 kermans and has more solar power. The
	new core is in a stable orbit at 100km.

*	October 4, 2013: Docked a tug module. This small module is basically just
	some docking ports and RCS thrusters. It can be detached and used to move
	around other modules as needed.
